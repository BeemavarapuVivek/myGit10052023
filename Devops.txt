1.Manual process replaced with automation process on top of hundres of servers.
by using belos tools
  1.Checf =>push model
  2.Aansible =>pull model
Ansible
loadbalncer=> handles the load and distribute load equally
shell script: shell is a program to execuste group of linux command.
problem is consistency
CM(configuration management)=> its hve consistency

push modle=>cm communication with prod server nothing push model by using ssh/user
pull model => prod servert communication with configuration model nothing but pull model. by using Agent

  Four op 4 poplar tools to CM is 
  Ansible ,salt => push model
  Checf,puppet =>pull model
CM server can understand only files. with help of IAC (infrastucture as code)
Yml  and Ruby format 
provisioning => provide suitable environments for deploying applications
ex:test,prod
install softwares
creating files and folder
creating users and groups
change config files
deploying applications

operting system: its is interface between end user and computer hardware devices
single user- single task ex:ms-dos
single user- multi tasking ex:windows
multi user - multi tasking ex:unix,linux
su -switch user
1.create folder:
mkdir <folder Name> 
2.create file
cate <file Name>

3.copy file
cp -r <source file location> <
destination file location>
4.rm <filename>
 rm -rf <foldername>
vi is a editor in linux



apt-get install apache2
vi sudo is the configuration file
ctr+x then enter y
suto apt-get install apache2

ssh pwd less authentication

master server login into other node servers
should not use pem file and pws
pem file nothing but it having private key

SSH pwd less authentication
---------------------------
1.configure master server
2.configure node servers
3. communicate master to user without pem file pwd

How to configure master server
 a. create awt server with ubuntu2.0 server, t2 micro
 b. by using git bash and pem file we can getting into the server
 c. swich to root user => $sudo -i
 d. need to update new server =>#apt-get update
 e. add user => #adduser <user name>
                  then set pwd
 f. make it sudo user =>#visudo
       vivek ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
       ctr+X ,yes,press Enter
 g. vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config       (without pem, with pwd)
     Passwordauthenitcation yes
     shift + : wq!
 h.to reflect out changes need to restart server
   $service SSH restart

same steps to configure NODE server

3.communicate master to node without pem file pwd on master as vivek
$sudo -i
#su maha   (# is nothing but root user,$ is nothing but normal user)
$cd (change directory)
$pwd =>(/home/maha)
ssh-keygen =>it will genereate two keys one private and public
ssh-copy-id <private ip of nodes ex:172.31.89.156>
           for teh first time it sis asking pwd so,enter pwd
ssh <private ip of node server> (without pwd ,without pwd)
exit
again=> ssh <private ip of node server>
       now it wont ask any pwd to ask

Git version control

Git usage : for each and every change we can able to create code version
1.create a github account and login
2.create a token it is just like your pwd
3.create a new Repository on github
4.install git on your laptop
5.create folder and open folder
6.inside folder open gitbash and execute below commands(only once)
  echo "# myGit10052023" >> README.md
  git init
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "first commit"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/BeemavarapuVivek/myGit10052023.git
  git push -u origin main

7.for remaning every change we have to execute below commands
 git add -A
 git commit -m "comment"
 git push

What is Ansible
it is configuration management, simple it automation build tool,
it use play books
to create infrastructure as code
for deploying suitable env

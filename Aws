Network basis
Network=>if we can communicate b/w more than two device nothing but network
static network=> its fixed network
Dynamic network => automatically happen
IP=>
networkid=>
subnetwork=>
classful network
classness network
Router =>Nothing but network Ex:Road
Modem  =>Nothing but internet EX:vehical
Private Ip => withing the same net work, we can able to communicate other device => laptop
public Ip => we can communicate two device with different network => flipcart server

   we can able to communicate private to private
   we can able to communicate public to public
   but to communicate from private to public we need NAT
   i.e NAT(Network access translater) is like translater to private to public
    which is maintained by network providers
  so 
what is difference b/w public ip Private Ip
What is NAT => network access translater
What is Sunetting 
IP means =>
class C =>End User
------------------
Each and every ip has 4 decimals
Each and every decimal is an octa (8)
A 32 bit of octa decimal unical(unique) identification number per a device(computer) on same network
or 
32 bit address,used to uniquely identify computer on network

ex:192.168.0.1 
255.255.255.0
8+8+8+8=>32
4 decimals.
 
total net work bits>
IP4 Adress 192.168.0.119
Network id => 192.168.0 
Host Id =>119
min 0 and max no is 255
total 256 ips
how to create IPs
2^(total network bits-occupaid bits)-2=total ips
2^(32-24)-2=>2^6=>256 ips

class B =>ISP:internet service provider
--------------------------------------
subnet mask=>255.255.0.0
if subnet id change then network ip will change,host id will change
total network=>8+8+0+0 =16 Ips
Total ips =>2^(total network bits-occupaid bits)-2
2^(32-16)-2=>2^16-2=>2^14=> 65,534 ips we can create

IP4 Adress 192.168.185.72
Network id => 192.168
Host Id =>.185.72
Ex: it will fallow analog
255.255.0.0-255  =>ex:255.255.0.0,255.255.0.1,255.255.0.2 ..... 255.255.0.255
255.255.1.0-255  =>ex:255.255.1.0,255.255.1.1,255.255.0.2 ..... 255.255.1.255
255.255.2.0-255  =>ex:255.255.2.0,255.255.2.1,255.255.0.2 ..... 255.255.2.255
255.255.3.0-255  =>ex:255.255.3.0,255.255.3.1,255.255.3.2 ..... 255.255.3.255

class A =>Brodband(ex:TCS):
------------------------
subnet mask=>255.255.0.0
if subnet id change then network ip will change,host id will change
total network=>8+0+0+0 =8 Ips
Total ips =>2^(total network bits-occupaid bits)-2
2^(32-8)-2=>2^26-2=>2^24=> 16,777,214 ps ,we can create

IP4 Adress 192.168.185.72
Network id => 192
Host Id =>168.185.72

class full network 
------------------
it is a fixed network
we can't change network
we can't customize network
it is use octa decimals 1's or 8's
subnet mask=>255.255.0.0
if subnet id change then network ip will change,host id will change
total network=>8+0+0+0 =8 Ips
Total ips =>2^(total network bits-occupaid bits)-2
2^(32-8)-2=>2^26-2=>2^24=> 16,777,214

classless net work=>
------------------
1.we can change network
2.we can customize network
3.its use binary farmat 0's and 1's
tota net work bits 11111111+11111111+11111111+11111111=>32 bits
Default network =192.168.0.1
IPv4 Address ......192.168.185.72
subnet mask .......255.255.255.0
total network occupaid bits =>11111111+11111111+11111111+00000000=>24bits
how may ips we can create >
Total ips =>2^(total network bits-occupaid bits)-2
2^(total network bits-occupaid bits)-2=total ips
2^(32-24)-2=>2^6=>256 ips

we change from right to left that is called CIDR=>Classless Inter Domain Route
11111111+11111111+11111110+00000000=>23bits
CIDR Range=> 23
how may ips we can create >
Total ips =>2^(total network bits-occupaid bits)-2
2^(total network bits-occupaid bits)-2=total ips
2^(32-24)-2=>2^6=>256 ips

we can also check with subnet calculater,which is available at internet

1.Router Nothing but network Ex:Road
2.modem  Nothing but internet EX:vehical
